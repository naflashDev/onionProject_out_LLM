# @ Description:
# This FastAPI router provides endpoints for managing and retrieving RSS feed
# metadata stored in a PostgreSQL database. It supports:
#
# 1. `GET /search-and-insert-rss`: Initiates a background thread that periodically
#    (every 25 hours) reads a list of URLs from a local file, extracts valid RSS feeds
#    by scraping those URLs asynchronously, and stores the extracted feed metadata
#    (such as feed title, site URL, and other relevant information) in the database.
#    This process runs independently from the main event loop, preventing blocking
#    of the FastAPI server.
#
# 2. `GET /feeds`: Retrieves a list of stored RSS feeds from the PostgreSQL database,
#    supporting a `limit` query parameter to control the number of results returned
#    (default is 10, with limits between 1 and 100).
#
# The module leverages asynchronous database interactions for efficient queries,
# combined with a safe threading approach to perform periodic background scraping
# without affecting the responsiveness of the API server.
#
# This setup is designed to facilitate automated, ongoing collection and organization
# of cybersecurity-related RSS feed sources.
