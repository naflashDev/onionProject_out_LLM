# @ Description:
# This FastAPI router provides endpoints for managing and executing a dynamic
# news scraping system. It includes functionality to:
#
# - Submit and validate RSS feed URLs (e.g., from Google Alerts),
# - Trigger asynchronous scraping tasks using dynamic spiders,
# - Schedule periodic scraping jobs to extract cybersecurity-related news,
# - Automatically collect and process links from RSS feeds into structured data,
# - Store or retrieve data using a PostgreSQL backend,
# - Initiate recurring background jobs that execute every 24 hours.
#
# The system is built for asynchronous execution and integrates file I/O,
# background scheduling with threads, structured error handling, and persistent
# feed metadata storage for reliable news data collection.
